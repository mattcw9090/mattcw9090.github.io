# MyFinanceTracker Portfolio Page

This repository hosts the portfolio landing page for **MyFinanceTracker**, an iOS application I developed. The page highlights the app’s capabilities, user-friendly interface, and demonstrates my work as an iOS developer. It also includes a contact form for potential clients interested in my freelance services.

## Features

  A clean, responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- **Intuitive Navigation:**  
  A sticky top navigation bar makes it easy to browse sections: About, Features, Demos, and Contact.

- **Hero Section & Engaging Content:**  
  A visually appealing hero section introduces the MyFinanceTracker app and encourages users to learn more or hire me.

- **Showcased App Features:**  
  Clear feature cards and descriptive text outline core functionalities such as net income tracking, cash flow management, and quick-add transactions.

- **Interactive Demos & Screenshots:**  
  Space to include a video demo link and screenshots that give visitors a closer look at the application’s UI.

- **Contact Form for Freelance Inquiries:**  
  A built-in contact form (using `mailto:`) invites potential clients to reach out with project details.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.github.io.git
   ```
   
   If you’re placing this page in a project-specific repo (e.g., `myfinancetracker-portfolio`), clone that repo instead:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/myfinancetracker-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd myfinancetracker-portfolio
   ```

3. **Open `index.html`:**
   Open `index.html` in your browser to see the live preview:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   
   Or simply drag the `index.html` file into your preferred web browser.

## Deployment

To host the page on GitHub Pages:

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Select the branch (usually `main`) and the `/root` directory for your pages.
4. Save the settings and GitHub Pages will provide a live URL (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/`).

## Customization

- **Add Screenshots/Demos:**  
  Replace the placeholder images and video links in the `index.html` file’s demos section.

- **Update Branding:**  
  Modify colors, fonts, or background images in `css/main.css`.

  Update the `mailto:` link in the `index.html` contact form to use your preferred email address.
